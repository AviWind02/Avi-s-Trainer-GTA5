# GTA 5 Trainer Using Script Hook V

This is a **GTA 5 Trainer** built using **Script Hook V**. The trainer features a custom user interface (UI) that is **Native-based** and also includes **ImGui** for additional enhancements. This project is part of my journey to improve my skills in C++ by creating a fully functional mod.

The UI is somewhat **mouse-controlled** natively, which was a challenging but a nice experience to implement. It was a bit of a pain to add mouse functionality natively, but I managed to get it working with some assistance.

## Features

- **Script Hook V Integration**: The trainer utilizes Script Hook V to manipulate the game.
- **Custom UI**: A combination of native UI elements and ImGui for more advanced customization.
- **Mouse Support**: The UI has native mouse control support, making it a bit more interactive and user-friendly.

## Controls

Here are the controls for navigating through the UI and using the trainer:

### Keyboard Controls:
- **Down Arrow**:  
  - `VK_DOWN` or `VK_NUMPAD2` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_DOWN`
-  **Up Arrow**:  
  - `VK_UP` or `VK_NUMPAD8` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_UP`
- **Right Arrow**:  
  - `VK_RIGHT` or `VK_NUMPAD6` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_RIGHT`
- **Left Arrow**:  
  - `VK_LEFT` or `VK_NUMPAD4` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_LEFT`
- **Select/Confirm**:  
  - `VK_RETURN` or `VK_NUMPAD5` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_ACCEPT` or `INPUT_CURSOR_ACCEPT`
- **Back/Cancel**:  
  - `VK_BACK` or `VK_NUMPAD0` or `INPUT_FRONTEND_CANCEL`

## About the Project

This project is a personal learning experience aimed at helping me get better at C++ while building something useful and fun. The UI was an interesting challenge, and the fact that it's somewhat mouse-controlled adds an extra layer of complexity and fun.

### Notes

- This trainer is intended for **single-player** use only and should not be used in online multiplayer, as it may result in bans or other consequences.
